# Module 6 Challenge
This application is a simple Weather Dashboard that allows the user to search for a specific city's weather. Once the user inputs a city the current weather will display with a visual of the weather and the temperature, humidity, and wind. The application will also show the city's forecast for the next 5 days including the same info as the current weather. The user's search history will appear on the left hand side and gives the user the ability to click on that specific search and it will load that city's weather again.
